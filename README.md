api - contain user and event details (if possible split both of them)
kids - contain details about the clubs attendanance
inventory - contain hardwares in kids 


APIs that needs fixing: (these are under KIDS)
            --> 'attendance'
            --> 'process'
            --> 'face'
            --> 'punch'
            --> "memberlogin"
            --> 'punchtime/sort'




make it more modularise so it would be easy to maintain.
